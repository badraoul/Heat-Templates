# Heat-Templates
place were I share heat templates and stuff.

Right now I have a simple stack that creates two servers.  One is intended to be a web server.  I also create a new floating ip and assign it to this server.  The second is supposed to be a database server.  I create a new Volume and attach it to this server.
